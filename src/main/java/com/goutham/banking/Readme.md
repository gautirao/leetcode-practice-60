Create accounts with a unique ID and balance

Transfer money between accounts

Validate that the sender has sufficient funds

Prevent negative balances

Handle edge cases (nonexistent accounts, negative transfer amounts)

Also:

Write unit tests using JUnit

Use Java 17 features

Emphasize clean code, domain modeling, and testability
